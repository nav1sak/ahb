Conclusion
Design and simulation of the AHB to APB bridge adequately prove a synthesizable and efficient interface for interoperability between high-speed AHB modules and low-power APB peripherals. The bridge, as implemented, correctly converts AHB transfers to APB transactions, supporting address latching, decoding, data transfer, as well as timing control according to the AMBA specification. Simulation outputs verify proper functioning for single read as well as single write, and synthesis outputs confirm hardware implementability of the design. The implementation offers a robust and scalable solution for merging varied bus architectures into SoC designs.
